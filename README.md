Utilities for processing open data related to Tampere public transport

## Purpose

These routines help to massage the Tampere Public Transport
[GTFS data](http://wiki.itsfactory.fi/index.php/Tampere_Public_Transport_GTFS_feed)
provided by [ITS Factory](http://www.hermiagroup.fi/its-factory/)
into formats more suitable for use in applications. They are primary intended to
help the development of [BusMonTRE](http://www.coniferproductions.com/apps/busmontre/),
but are released as open source, in the hope that other
application developers will find them useful.

The Tampere Public Transport data is released under
[its own license](http://www.tampere.fi/tampereinfo/avoindata/avoindatalisenssi.html)
(in Finnish only), so it is not duplicated here.

## Installation and usage

Use [cargo-install](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html) to install and run.

## About the name

It's a pun, of course:

* _Tr√®s jolie_ is French for _very nice_
* _TRE_ is a common abbreviation for [Tampere](http://www.tampere.fi)
* Public transport is _joukkoliikenne_ in Finnish, sometimes abbreviated as _joli_
* The _e_ is for example (_esimerkki_ in Finnish)
